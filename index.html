        <p>The ancient city of Nippur was a vibrant and ethnically diverse polis populated by Babylonians and Non-Babylonians alike. <br> <br>
        We set out to learn to what degree did Non-Babylonians differ from Babylonians in their religious observance. <span class="arrow"> &#9654</span></p>

          <p> Traditionally, scholars have turned to priestly and regal texts to learn about a civilization. <br> <br>
          However, these texts can only reveal how the elite groups practiced their relgions and shed little light on the practices and beliefs of the commoners.
          <br> <br>
          What information could there be that may uncover the religious participation of regular folk? <br> <br>
          And, how much did such potential religious participation have to do with ethnicity?

        <div class="content">
          <p> In order to gain access to non-elite social circles, we combined information from two types of texts: <br> <br>
          common texts recording the transactions of middle class people;<br> <br>
          and a religious text known today as the <strong>Babylonian Almanac</strong>, which notes for each day of the calendar year whether it is positive/lucky or not.
          <br> <br>
          <p>Our expectation was that Babylonians would proscribe to the <strong>Babylonian Almanac</strong> and would avoid doing business on negative days, while targeting positive days for their transactions. <br> <br>
          On the other hand, the transactions of non-Babylonians would be evenly distributed on both positive and negative days.<span class="arrow"> &#9654</span></p>
        </div>
        <div class="content">
        <p>
          We collected 6,000 personal names from 600 texts, tagged them as either Babylonians or non-Babylonians.<br> <br>
          We then determined whether they conducted a transaction on a positive ("good luck") or negative("bad luck") day.<br> <br>
          Finally, we analyzed whether there was any difference in adherence to the <strong>Babylonian Almanac</strong> based on ethnicity.
          <br> <br>
        <p>
          We also divided the individuals into seperate groupings to determine if there were any other trends. <br> <br>
          For instance, are there differences in practice based on the time of year of the transaction? What about over the course of time, from one king to the next?

        <p>
          In this visualization, each individual that conducted a transaction is represeted by a <img src="blue.png" style="width:20px;height:20px;" class="square">. <br> <br>
          The color of the square indicates ethnicity (Babylonian, Non-Babylonian, or Unknown). <br> <br>
